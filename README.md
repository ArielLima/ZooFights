## Zoo Fights

A game in which you can pit different zoo animals against each other

### This project is a challenge/practice project with the intent of giving new/wannabe developers the opportunity to familiarize themselves with Java.

#### Inside src/zoo there exists a base Animal class, your job is to create a custom animal through that class and override all methods to fit correctly with the attributes of said animal

Steps to contribute:
- Fork the repo
- Develope in your own fork
- make a different PR for each additional or change to specific animal, keep your PR's small in order to keep work fast
- All existing PR's will be checked and reviewed every week

## Have Fun Developing!

DISCLAIMER: No animals were hurt in the making of this game
